So, here is the logic of the game:

I HAVE REPLACED THE GIVEN COOKIE IMAGE WITH A TRANSPARENT PNG TO OVERLAY IT ON THE SCREEN
You have to cut the cookie in half by moving your hand in the cookie.
The cookie will be displayed on the screen and you have to cut it by moving your hand in the cookie.
The tip of your index finger will be used to cut the cookie.
Time limit is 40 seconds. (Assuming 30 FPS)
For every successful cut, the score will increase by 1.
If the score is greater than 500, you win the game.
If the time limit is reached, you lose the game.

ENJOY!
